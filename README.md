# Car Price Prediction using Regression Models

This project explores various regression techniques to develop a predictive model for car prices using the [Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset). The aim is to demonstrate the process of building, evaluating, and enhancing regression models for real-world applications.

## 🚗 Project Overview

The notebook walks through the complete machine learning pipeline including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Data Pipelines**
- **Model Evaluation (R², MSE)**
- **Model Comparison and Selection**

## 📊 Algorithms Used

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Scikit-learn Pipelines

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- R-squared (R²)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visual tools: regression plots, residual plots, distribution plots

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset)
- Features include horsepower, engine size, curb weight, highway-mpg, and others.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
    ```
    jupyter notebook Predictive_Model_Development_Cars.ipynb
    ```
